# DanProject

## What is this project

This project is my attempt to create an c# core blazor application, and understand the different render modes and how to optimize those.
I will attempt to integrate this project with containerization and figure out, how to dynamically load different elements using the server render technology.


## Features that are going to be implemented

- Auth. (Using an SSO with Docker / Kubernetes)
  -- Using different policies
- Implement CORS
- 

### Requirements

- That the end user can login, access an project and add resources to that.
